Monitoring, Patient Safety, Health Monitoring . Introduction : 
In our quickly aging society, a major challenge 
in healthcare is ensuring that elderly and 
differentl y-abled individuals follow their 
prescribed medication schedules. Medication 
mismanagement, whether due to forgetfulness, 
incorrect pill intake, or missed doses, is a 
serious issue that can lead to severe health 
problems and more hospital visits. While 
technology has provided some solutions, 
current IoT medicine boxes often act only as 
reminders. This includes checking the medication 
being taken, providing alerts for all users, and 
establishing a real -time communication link 
between the patient and their caregivers. The 
problem is particu larly serious for patients who 
cannot rely on traditional audio alerts, making 
current solutions ineffective for many people. The lack of automated features, such as expiry 
and refill tracking adds to this issue, placing the 
responsibility for managing com plex 
medication schedules on both the patient and 
their family. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents 
the "Unique IoT Medicine Box with Smart 
Wristband." This innovative dual -system is 
designed to provide timely, correct, and safe 
medication man agement. Additionally, the system includes a smart 
wristband that meets the needs of deaf, elderly, 
and visually impaired users. The wristband 
provides alerts through vibrations and flashing Madhu  Mithra  A Dhanushraagav  S Sandeep  Kumar  J

medication reminder, even wh en audio alerts 
are not available. The whole system connects to a cloud -based 
platform that tracks medication history, 
monitors expiry d ates, and sends automatic 
refill notifications. Ultimately, the Unique IoT Medicine Box with 
Smart Wristband aims to change medication 
management from a passive reminder into a 
proactive, intelligent, and inclusive healthcare 
solution. By combining smart locking 
mechanisms, AI verification, real -time alerts 
for caregivers, and a wearable component, this 
system could greatly improve medication 
adherence and safety for vulnerable patients. The expected benefits include fewer hospital 
visits caused by medication errors, real -time 
communication with doctors and family 
members, and an overall improvement in 
patient well -being and  independence. While they serve 
a pur pose, they don’t offer reminders or any 
sort of verification to ensure medications are 
taken correctly, nor do they facilitate caregiver 
oversight, which can be crucial for some 
patients. Unfortunately, they still fall short in several 
areas, missing out on advanced capabilities like 
AI-driven pill verification an d multi -sensory 
alerts that would benefit users with various 
disabilities. It results in poor treatment 
outcomes, more a voidable hospitalisations, and 
increased financial strain on both patients and 
the healthcare system. While traditional 
pillboxes and simple reminder systems provide 
some help, they have significant shortcomings. They cannot verify if the right medication has 
been taken and do not support patients with 
disabilities, like those who are deaf or visually 
impaired. Additionally, these systems often 
lack real -time monitoring and emergency alerts, 
leaving caregivers and healthcare providers 
unaware of critical mi stakes until it is too late. User Interface (UI)/User Experience (UX) 
Design: Develop wireframes and mockups for 
the mo bile app and cloud dashboard, focusing 
on ease of use for elderly patients and 
caregivers. Pill 
Verification: Integrate a mini camera and a 
small microcontroller, like an ESP -CAM, for 
image capture. Wristband Development: Wearable 
Components: Choose a small microcontroller, 
such as the ESP32 -C3, for the wristband. Phase 3: Software Development and Embedded 
Programming (C++):  
Develop the code for the ESP32 to manage the 
timed schedule, control the servo motors for 
each compartment, and activate the alerts, 
including the buzzer and LEDs. Mobile/Web Application Development: User 
Dashboard: Design a straightforward and easy -
to-use interface for caregivers to view real -time 
adherence logs, set medicat ion schedules, and 
manage user profiles. Alert Configuration: Allow users to 
customize alert types, including audio, 
vibration, and visual signals, and to set 
emergency contacts. Phase 4: System Integration and Testing Unit 
Testing: Test individual components, such as 
sensors, motors, and communication modules, 
to ensure they work correctly. Integration 
Testing: Test the entire system to confirm 
smooth communication between the med icine 
box, wristband, and cloud platform. User 
Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conduct testing 
with a small group of target users, such as 
elderly patients and caregivers, to collect 
feedback and make necessary improvements to 
the UI/UX . If a wrong pill is 
detected, the system sends a fail -safe alert to the 
patient and their care givers. Also, weight 
sensors in each compartment serve two 
purposes: they confirm that a pill has been 
removed and provide a reliable record that the 
dose was not only accessed but also taken. It works with the 
medicine box, providing a multi -sensory alert system. In addition to standard auditory 
reminders, the wristband vibrates for users with 
hearing or visual impairments, ensuring they 
never miss a dose, regardless of their abilities. Medication schedules, adherence logs, and 
critical alerts  are stored and managed in the 
cloud. This 
allows caregivers, family members, and 
healthcare providers to monitor a patient’s 
medication history and receive instant 
notifications. 1: Block Diagram of the IoT Smart Medicine Box System
