Abstract - Medication mismanagement is a 
serious problem for elderly patients, especially 
those who are forgetful, deaf, or have 
disabilities. The Unique IoT Medicine Box with Smart 
Wristband is a healthcare solution that ensures 
timely, correct, and safe medication. The system 
features smart locking compartments that only 
open the correct slot, AI -based pill  verification, 
expiry and refill tracking, emergency alerts to 
family or doctors, and smart wristband alerts 
with vibration and LED for deaf or elderly users. The Unique IoT Medicine Box with Smart 
Wristband offers a complete solution for safe, 
timely, and accurate medication intake. This 
system includes smart locking compartments that 
open only the correct medicine slot at the right 
time, along with  AI-driven pill verification using 
QR code scanning. The 
smart wristband gives vibra tion and LED alerts 
that are designed for elderly users with hearing 
or visual impairments, which helps improve user 
compliance. Introduction - Medication adherence is a major 
issue in healthcare, especially for elderly 
patients, those with chronic illnesse s, and 
individuals with disabilities. This system shares medication 
schedules, patient information, an d alerts with 
cloud -based applications that caregivers and 
medical professionals can access. Wearable devices 
such as sm art wristbands provide multi -sensory 
alerts for patients with hearing or vision 
impairments, improving accessibility and 
responsiveness. This project aims to develop a smart medicine 
box paired with a smart wristband, using AI -
based pill verification to boost accuracy and 
safety. Weight sensors in the compartments check 
if a pill has been taken, making sure patients are 
not just reminded but also actually taking their 
medication. Acknowledging that older adults and differently -
abled users may have issues like hearing or 
visual impairments, a smart wristband works 
with the medicine box’s alert system. The 
wristband offers discreet vibration alerts and 
visual LED signals alongsi de auditory 
reminders, creating multi -sensory cues tailored 
to individual needs. The entire system connects 
to cloud services for real -time updates on 
medication schedules, adherence logs, and refill 
alerts. Future updates may include 
biometric authentication for secure access, 
integration with electronic health record (EHR) 
systems, and predictive analytics to spot patterns 
of non -adherence and suggest tailored 
intervent ions. The propos ed IoT -based smart 
medicine box along with the smart wristband 
ensures correct medication intake through locked 
compartments and AI -based pill verification. 1: Block Diagram of the IoT Smart Medicine Box System with 
Hardware Components and Cloud Integration  
Medicine Box:  This is the primary hardware 
device housing multiple locking compartments, 
each designated for a specific medication dose. AI QR Pill Verification Camera:  Inside  the 
medicine box, the mini camera scans QR codes 
on medicine packets for AI -based verification to 
ensure the correct pill is dispensed, adding a 
layer of safety against medication errors. RGB LEDs and OLED Display:  Visual 
indicators provide status alerts to the user, such 
as medication time or errors, displayed 
conveniently on the box itself. Smart Wris tband:  Connected via Bluetooth 
Low Energy (BLE) to the medicine box, the 
wristband delivers tactile vibration alerts and 
LED signals, aimed especially at elderly or 
differently -abled users who may not respond 
well to audio alerts. Cloud Server:  The medicin e box connects to the 
cloud via Wi -Fi, where medication schedules, 
logs, pill expiry, and refill tracking data are securely stored and processed . Visual alerts are provided through RGB LEDs 
inside the box, along with an OLED display for 
conveying medicine status and inform ation. Additionally, a smart wristband that includes 
ESP32 BLE is provided to deliver vibration and 
LED alerts directly to the patient. An emergency alert system 
automatically notifies caregivers or medical 
professi onals in case of missed doses, while a 
dashboard application offers a comprehensive 
view of medication adherence history and health 
trends. Estimated Cost -   The estimated total cost for 
the IoT Smart Medicine Box project is roughly 
between ₹4,500 and ₹7,200. These 
are the ESP32 microcontroller (₹500 -₹800), 
servo m otors (₹400 -₹600), a mini camera for pill 
verification (₹800 -₹1500), IR weight sensors 
(₹200 -₹400), RGB LEDs (₹300 -₹500), an OLED 
display (₹400 -₹600), a Li -ion battery for backup 
power (₹300 -₹500), a custom medicine box 
casing (₹400 -₹600), and the smart wr istband 
with an ESP32 BLE module for vibration and 
LED alerts (₹600 -₹1200). The total estimated cost for 
the IoT Smart Medicine Box project is 
approximately between ₹4,500 and ₹7,200. Conclusion - In conclu sion, the Unique IoT 
Smart Medicine Box with Smart Wristband 
presents an innovative and practical solution to 
the widespread problem of medication 
mismanagement among elderly and differently -
abled patients. By integrating secure, smart 
locking compartments  with AI -based pill 
verification, multi -sensory alert systems, and 
real-time remote monitoring, the system not only 
ensures timely and accurate medication intake 
but also enhances patient safety and 
independence. "IoT -
